Installation:

You'll need internal-hooks.scm and user-hooks.scm in $HOME/.elinks

I used Guile 1.5.6, in case that matters.


Status:

Where Lua hooks would have been called, Guile hooks are now called.
The rest of the stuff from Links-Lua hasn't been done.


Disclaimer:

I didn't read the Guile manual when writing this.  Actually, I don't
think there is a manual yet.
