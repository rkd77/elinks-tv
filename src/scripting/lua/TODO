Internal lua scripting support still looks a lot like a temporary hack:

* internal scripting support should be independent on actual language (it would
  be nice to support ie. perl as well, with minimal code duplication)
* there should be some generic options interface exported by ELinks
* there should be some better hooking mechanism.. on load-time, it should be
  possible to register any functions to any hooks, not only having one function
  per hook (thus making the whole thing much more flexible and making it
  possible to finally generalize hooks.lua)

Lua scripting is considered as additional feature, so probably anything
regarding it won't be ever release goal; however, the proper support is still
very important for ELinks, it only means that reworking it may occur and will
be accepted at almost any point in ELinks development process; so, if you want
to help us with ELinks and look for some really separated part where you can
let your invention do almost anything it want and easily rebuild the interface
from the scratch (or you can just hack it, it's up to you), this is your place!
