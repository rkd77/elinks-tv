				Scripting TODO List

- We should let the event propagation decision to the user-supplied function in
  fact, we should let user to hook multiple functions to an event so in fact
  the scripting layers would interface the events subsystem much more
  transparently.

- More generalization of things currently only part of the Lua backend. The
  console and (error) dialog stuff should be generalized so all backends can
  use them. The same goes for the run_lua_func() used to run scripting
  functions bound to keystrokes.
