We could add also support for:

* cryptlib (http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/ - it is distributed
 in zip form which doesn't look very business-like, and it lacks manual in a
 format conviently readable for me; however, they say it is damn fast and very
 easy to use)

Possibly, we should drop support for native GnuTLS and use their OpenSSL
wrapper instead, since I happen to feel very unsure about GnuTLS interface -
OpenSSL is not much better, but we can steal code from other applications ;-).

We should get some certificates managment and mainly _serious_ and _reliable_
verification of peers' certificates, including URN checking etc etc. We have
serious problems with this and I'm not going to learn real OpenSSL (from
nowhere as I didn't find any usable documentation for OpenSSL) just to fix
this, sorry; someone else must do this.
