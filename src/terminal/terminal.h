	 *
	 * Tabs are special windows, though, and you never want to display them
	 * all, but only one of them. ALWAYS check inactive_tab() during
	 * iterations through this list (unless it is really useless or you
	 * are sure what are you doing) to make sure that you don't distribute
	 * events etc to inactive tabs.
	 *
	 * The stack is top-down, thus @c .next is the stack's top, the
	 * current window; and @c .prev is the bottom, covered by others.
	 * - Dialogs or active menus are at the top.
	 * - Next come all tabs (window.type == ::WINDOW_TAB).  The tab
	 *   listed leftmost in the tab bar is at the top, and the tab
	 *   listed rightmost is at the bottom; but #current_tab controls
	 *   which tab is actually displayed.
	 * - If the main menu is inactive, then it is at the very bottom,
	 *   hidden under the tabs.
	 * Call assert_window_stacking() to verify this.
	 *
	 * @todo FIXME: Tabs violate the stack nature of this list, they
	 * appear there randomly but always in the order in which they were
	 * inserted there.  Eventually, they should all live at the stack
	 * bottom, with the actual tab living on the VERY bottom. --pasky
	 *
	 *   Keeping the current tab at the very bottom would require storing
	 *   tab numbers explicitly, rather than computing them from the
	 *   stack order as is done now.  Also, what should be done with the
